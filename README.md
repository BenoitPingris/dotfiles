This repository contains useful information about my system :

 - zsh
 - oh-my-zsh
 - emacs
 - vscode
	 - extensions
	 - settings

It also contains a small script to automate the installation of the packages listed above.

```bash
chmod +x installer.sh
./installer.sh #(without sudo!)
```

## My current system
I'm using manjaro 17.1.12 XFCE edition
