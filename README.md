This repository contains useful informations about my setup

En vrac:
- fish with oh-my-fish ~~(shell I use)~~
- zsh with oh-my-zsh (shell I use !)
- vscode's extensions and settings
- onivim (Vim but it's pretty)
- a lot of scripts

I'm using Manjaro 18.0.3. My desktop manager is LXQt with i3, the tilling manager (best combo)

It also contains a script that is supposed to install all the required packages to run my setup

```bash
chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

Some screenshots of my beautiful setup:
